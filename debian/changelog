rdkit (201112-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  The RDKit book license has been clarified to
    Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License, so a stripped
    original tarball is no longer required.

  [ Michael Banck ]
  * debian/control (python-rdkit): Added python-numpy to Depends.
  * debian/rdkit-doc.install: Fix path (Closes: #661976).
  * debian/rules (override_dh_auto_test): Copy over python files into obj
    directory and set $PYTHONPATH correctly, thanks to Jakub Wilk.  Also set
    $RDBASE accordingly.
  * debian/rules (override_dh_auto_clean): New target, remove some files added
    during build which do not get removed by the default dh_auto_clean.

  [ Daniel Leidert (dale) ]
  * debian/watch: Added.
