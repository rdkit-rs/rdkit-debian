Description: Collection of cheminformatics and machine-learning software
 RDKit is a Python/C++ based cheminformatics and machine-learning software
 environment.  Features Include:
 .
  * Chemical reaction handling and transforms
  * Substructure searching with SMARTS
  * Canonical SMILES
  * Molecule-molecule alignment
  * Large number of molecular descriptors, including topological,
    compositional, EState, SlogP/SMR, VSA and Feature-map vectors
  * Fragmentation using RECAP rules
  * 2D coordinate generation and depiction, including constrained depiction
  * 3D coordinate generation using geometry embedding
  * UFF and MMFF94 forcefields
  * Chirality support, including calculation of (R/S) stereochemistry codes
  * 2D pharmacophore searching
  * Fingerprinting, including Daylight-like, atom pairs, topological
    torsions, Morgan alogrithm and MACCS keys
  * Calculation of shape similarity
  * Multi-molecule maximum common substructure
  * Machine-learning via clustering and information theory algorithms
  * Gasteiger-Marsili partial charge calculation
 .
 File formats RDKit supports include MDL Mol, PDB, SDF, TDT, SMILES and RDKit
 binary format.
